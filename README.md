# Web Socket Doddles

This is a **remake** of the original **Web Socket Doddles** project, which was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This version has been refactored using **React** and **Vite** for a more modern and scalable approach.

**Web Socket Doddles** is a fun little school project made to test real-time WebSocket communication between users and an admin. It’s a quiz app where users can buzz in to answer questions, and the admin can control the session and dispatch questions.

## How It Works

- **Users**: Connect to the session, receive questions, and buzz in with their answers.
- **Admin**: Starts the session, controls the number of users, and sends questions to everyone.
- **Sessions**: Users can join a session as long as there’s space, and admins can set the user limit.
- **Real-time**: All interactions happen in real-time, with WebSockets ensuring immediate responses.

**This project is just for fun and testing.** Don’t expect production-ready features—this is just a playful doodle to test WebSockets in action.

## Future Plan

While this version is built with **React** and **Vite**, the project may still undergo improvements as I continue adding features and refactoring. Stay tuned for further updates and enhancements! ⚛️

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the UI with components and state management.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern JavaScript applications.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication between users and the admin.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Used for basic styling and structure in this version.
